  _description: It is traditional for Knights to pray to stars for fortune before
    a quest. It is said that those of pure heart who prayed with the most selfless
    intentions and the most passion would meet amongst the crowds of peasants who
    saw them off a mysterious little white-haired girl, who, with an innocent smile,
    would wish him luck and present him with this delicate little amulet.
