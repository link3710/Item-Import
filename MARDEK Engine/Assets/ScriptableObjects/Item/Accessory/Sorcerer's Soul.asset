  _displayName: Sorcerer's Soul
  _description: In life, this soul was a great sorcerer who possessed the power to
    move the stars themselves, yet he was never satisfied because his mortality loomed
    over him. In seeking immortality, he managed to magically remove his soul and
    preserve it in this state (it feels sort of like a ball of cotton). He grants
    a fraction of his spiritual power to whoever equips him.
